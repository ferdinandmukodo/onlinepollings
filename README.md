# Online Polls
#### Brief description of application
Almost every service currently is going digital where anyone can access it via web based platform. The primary objective of this project is to find solution for polls accessibility wherein the user can create polls to get responses from other user freely. This kind of project has been recently implimented by Meta Company,deploying the polls feature on Whatsapp and Facebook social media.

To solve this problem,  I have decided to create a polls website that helps clients who want to conduct polls and get responses.

* Login Page - Logs in user to use the application
* Sign Up page - Registers user to use the application
* User can create polls
* User can join polls and give their responses.



## Objective of the project
* Logs in user to the posts page when their username and password are verified
* Signs up user to enable the use the application
* User can create polls and get other users respond on their polls
* User remain logged in when browser refreshes. 
* User are logged out.
